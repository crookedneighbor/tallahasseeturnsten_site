            On November 5th, 2002 The Mountain Goats released Tallahassee.
            Artists and fans across genres love John Darnielle's wordy, probing
            songs; and for many, Tallahassee was the album that made us fall in
            love. To celebrate its tenth birthday, Crooked Neighbor has
            commissioned fifteen bands to cover the album's fourteen songs (and
            one b-side), creating Tallahassee Turns Ten: A Mountain Goats Cover
            Album.
